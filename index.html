  <h1>The Curation of CANMT</h1>
  
  Welcome to my curation of all CANWC (Cool and New Webcomic) songs from the CANMT (Cool and New Music Team.)<br>
  Due to the nature of CANWC a large majority of the songs are; for a lack of a better word: shitty.<br>
  Many people may be put off by this and decide to ignore the entirety of the discography as they assume it is all total trash.<br>
  I am here to assure you that this is not in fact the case and that the CANMT are an incredibly talented group of people who<br>
  come out with some excellent pieces of music and so I have trudged through the albums to bring you the diamonds in the rough.<br><br>
  
  There are a few catergories and rules associated with each of the catergories. The catergories are: Unlistenable, Listenable,<br>
  Good, Homestuck.<br>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
  Unlistenable: Music that is uncomfortable to listen to, it could be dissonant, lacking in substance, droning, loud or just<br>
  generally terrible. Any songs that are not included anywhere on this list are to be considered in this category.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
  Listenable: Anything that is pleasant to listen to, genre does not factor in as long as it sounds nice.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
  Good: This one is more personal preference, these are songs that I enjoy enough to go out of my way to listen to, this<br>
  category will usually follow the CAMMT's definition of "Memeless" this means no leimotifs that have voices or words of<br>
  some kind associated with them, there are of course exceptions to this rule.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
  Homestuck: This is a very specific category that is reserved for songs that I feel would not be out of place if they were<br>
  included in the Homestuck discography. This means that it is very likely that there will be very little or no meme<br>
  leitmotifs used in the song.<br><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
    
 Keep in mind these are all just my personal opinions. If you disagree with where a song is placed (if you think it should be<br> 
 moved up or down) I would love to hear your opinion and will attempt re-evaluate the song, you can get in contact with me by<br> 
 pming me at reddit.com/u/ivorycry.<br><br>
  
 Seeing as a lot of the songs are intentionally shitty, I mean no ill will towards anyone who produced a song that was not included<br>
 on the list so please don't take anything to heart.<br><br>
 
 So with all that out of the way here are the albums:<br><br>
